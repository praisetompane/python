        - in words: ???
        Q: Is there a formal notion/definition of a Python program?
        
    - plain english: ???
    
    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - flow: ???

        - composed of code blocks that:
            - run in an execution frame.

        def name resolution

        def block environment

        def exec()

        def eval()

        builtins and restricted execution
            def builtins

        interaction with dynamic features

        exceptions
            def exception

            def raised

            def handled
