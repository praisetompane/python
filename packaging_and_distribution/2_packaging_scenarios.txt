packaging considerations: target environment + deployment experience 
    - target audience:
        - developers
        - datacenter operators
        - non technical end users
        - ...
    - runtime environment:
        - servers
        - mobile devices
        - embedded systems
        - ...
    - deployment mechanism:
        - one software install
        - large deployment batches
        - ...


packaging scenarios:
    - libraries & tools:
        - target audience = developers AND runtime environment = development setting.
        - approaches:
            - python module: 
                - properties:
                    - constraints:
                        - only depends on the standard library.
                        - required python installed on runtime environment.
                - use cases: a single pure python file.
                - examples: 
                    - bottle.py
                
            - python source distributions: 
                - properties:
                    - specification: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/source-distribution-format/#source-distribution-format
                    - constraints:   
                        - required python installed on runtime environment.
                    - format: compressed zip(*.tar.gz)
                    - alternative names:
                        - sdist
                    - remarks: this is Python's native distribution format.
                - use cases: 
                    - a collection of pure python files. 

            - python binary distributions:
                - properties:
                    - specification: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#binary-distribution-format
                    - constraints:   
                        - required python installed on runtime environment.
                    - implementation: wheel
                    - recommendation: default to publishing BOTH wheel and sdist archives.
                    - remarks:
                        - pip prefers wheel format for speed, even for source distributions.
                - use cases: 
                    - pure python files and compiled dependencies written in(C,C++,FORTRAN, Rust, etc)
        
    - python applications:
        - target audience: non-technical end users AND runtime environment = end user machines.
        - key: selection of tools is reasoned from dependence on the runtime environment.
        - approaches:
            -
