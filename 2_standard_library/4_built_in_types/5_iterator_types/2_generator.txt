def generator | generator function: 
  - formal: ùëì: * ‚Ü¶ Generator Iterator
      - in words: a function that creates and returns a Generator Iterator.

  - plain english: ???

  - intuition: ???

  - properties:
    - specification: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/#motivation
    - all properties of iterators defined here: standard_library/3_built_in_types/4_iterator_types/0_iterator.py

  - examples:
    - useful example: src/applications/math/fibonacci.py

  - use cases:
    - process or generate N values without using up N memory. Especially useful when N is large or even greater than all available memory.
    - Just In Time processing: generate values as they become available and return them for processing them at call/client side.
    - create coroutines, which allows interleaving client code with library code:
      - this enables sequencing
  - proof: None. It is a definition.
