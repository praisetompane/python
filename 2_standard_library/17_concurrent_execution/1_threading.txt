    - properties:
        - specification: 
            - high level: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/threading.html
            - low level: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/_thread.html#module-_thread
        - implementation: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/threading.py
        - constraints:
            - CPython: Due to the Global Interpreter Lock(GIL), only one thread can execute python code at a time.
            - threading module not available on WebAssembly platforms(i.e. wasm32-emscripten, wasm32-wasi).
    - examples: see below

    - use cases:
        - multiple IO-bound tasks:
            - database calls
            - external network services calls
        
    - proof: None. It is a definition.
